<h2>Persona 1</h2>
  <P>  Persona #1 is young outdoor enthusiasts with a passion for nature. 
  They enjoy hiking, camping, and fishing in the higher elevations in the mountains near Preston and other surrounding towns. 
  They love the challenge of going to lesser visited areas. 
  They are not afraid of the typical weather patterns that can pop up in rugged terrain that can catch others off guard.
  It is important to them, however, to receive up to date alerts and information on any dangerous weather patterns that may 
  be coming into the area. 
  </P>

<h2>Persona 2</h2>
<p>
    Persona #2 is a family that enjoys nice summer vacations outside of their busy life in the city. 
    They enjoy the beauty of nature and having some fun in the great outdoors. 
    This group wants to have weather that is calm and just right for making smores over the campfire.  
    It's important to them to have correct weather forecasts for the areas they're travelling to so that 
    they don't have their family time rained on.
