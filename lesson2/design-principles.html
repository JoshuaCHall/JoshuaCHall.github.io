                When you first look at the Lego website, your eye is immediately drawn to the clean design of the homepage.
                The icons in the center of the page have a nice balance of white space that makes the area feel organized
                and easy to use. The icons are each unique, but because of how they are centered the page still
                feels clean and airy. The adequate white space throughout the page allows for each element to pop out and
                grab your attention without it feeling overwhelming.

            <p>Flickr uses the rule of alignment to its advantage by centering all the content within each area.
                It feels organized and doesn't overwhelm the user even though there are many photos.
                The clean alignment of the photos grabs your attention first. 
                The left alignment of the header and footer is a contrasting alignment against the centered
                photos. This helps the user focus on the login area and "start for free" buttons. 
                The centered column alignment is a large part of the clean organization of the site.

            <p>The Unsplash website uses visual hierarchy by first drawing the eye to the warm rosy color stating
                the site's purpose. This gives a starting reference point to the user allowing their eye to then
                move on to the white areas of the navigation bar and search field.
                The dark area talking about Vimeo video and the photo at the bottom then catch your attention last.
                This guides the user toward additional services available on the website.
