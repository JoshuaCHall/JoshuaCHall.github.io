                The Contrast of yellow that the search bar has against the white background
                is what gives this site an appeal. The yellow that is used gives the eye a point of reference to the
                site.
                It is also very clever that the color is part of the logos color scheme as well. the softness of the
                text
                draws your eye down to the rest of the site. the icons of the products pop out of the white space and
                catches your attention.

            <p>Flickr uses the role of alignment to is advantage by centering all the content.
                It feels less busy and more organized, not overwhelming the user
                with tons of pictures. The header is the reference point with the search icon.
                The footer also has centered text leading the user to the sign in for free button.
                Columns also help in the overall organization of the site.

            <p>The main text for the site is aligned to the side giving a good amount of space
                used of the background image. With the text spaced apart it gives the user opportunity to focus on the
                background.
                The text is also softer so that the user is no overwhelmed by it, the text is kept to a minimal amount.
                The icon for the site is given a generous amount of white space to help the user find it easy to
                navigate the options for the site.
